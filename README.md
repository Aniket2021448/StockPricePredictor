## 🚀 Overview  
StockSense is a web application that visualizes historical stock prices and predicts future trends using deep learning techniques. It leverages **Yahoo Finance API** to fetch stock market data and an **LSTM neural network** to forecast future price movements.  

### ✨ Features  
✅ Fetch real-time & historical stock price data using **Yahoo Finance API**  
✅ Perform **data preprocessing** and compute **moving averages**  
✅ Train an **LSTM neural network** for stock price prediction  
✅ Display **interactive visualizations** of stock trends & model forecasts  
✅ **User-friendly** Streamlit interface for smooth experience

🏗️ How It Works
1️⃣ Data Acquisition: Fetches historical stock prices via Yahoo Finance API
2️⃣ Preprocessing: Cleans data, calculates moving averages & prepares train-test sets
3️⃣ Model Training: Trains an LSTM-based deep learning model on historical data
4️⃣ Prediction: Uses the trained model to forecast future stock prices
5️⃣ Visualization: Displays stock trends & model predictions via interactive charts
